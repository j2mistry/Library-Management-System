1.3 Implementation:

Method of Implementation:-

We have used the agile method of implementation. As the agile development uses collaborative
efforts of the cross-functioning teams. In this development the working software is continuously
analyzed and tested.

Software Requirements:-

We have to have a browser for the viewing the main index page and the system and after that we
need a back-end to connect to the server ,in that case we have used Wamp and php in order to run
it on the localhost.

Hardware Requirements:-

To run this system we don’t need too much upgraded hardware but just the ample amount of
memory and disk would be good enough to run this application.
   A system running on Intel Core i3 or later.
   A memory of 2 GB.
   A 2 GB hard disk.

Technology Used:-
Front End : HTML, CSS, JSCRIPT, Materialise CSS
